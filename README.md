As part of the initiative, the City of Houston High Injury Network was identified. The High Injury Network 2022 (HIN) represents 9% of Houston streets which account for 58% of traffic deaths and serious injuries.

To display this information along with creashes, Vision Zero Crash Dashboards for 2022 and 2023 were created. The dashboards provides quarterly safety data and pinpoints crashes that resulted in serious injuries and traffic deaths in City of Houston limits in an easy-to-use format with data sortable by many categories.
